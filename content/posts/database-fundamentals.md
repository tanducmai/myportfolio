### What Is A Database

A collection of tables containing data that are used to retrieve information.

A collection of potentially useful data that models **real-world** or
**conceptual objects** and their **relationships**.

- Objects/Entities like People, Items, Students, etc.
- Relationships like Henry purchased an apple.
- Conceptual like films and songs (*intangible*).

### Database Management System

A database is managed by a Database Management System (DBMS) - a system that may
be manual or computerised.

To simplify, the DBMS is software designed to store and manage data across one
or more databases.

### Example

A typical example of a database is a library.

In the case of a library:

- Books = objects containing data
- Catalogue system = DBMS

### Why bother storing data

In fact, 90% of business data is rarely accessed again. So why bother?

There are primarily two reasons for it:

1. Compliance with laws and company regulations
1. Data Mining – maybe the data holds some hidden detail?

When having data stored, we can extract information and use it for decision
making.

1. Analyse the history.
1. Predict the future.

### Examples of facts analysed from stored data

- Car airbags kill 1 person for every 22 lives that they save.
- A new baby usually deprives each of it’s parents around 350-400 hours of sleep
  in the first year.
- On average, 100 people choke to death on ballpoint pens every year.
