##### What is a database?

A collection of tables containing data that are used to retrieve information.

A collection of potentially useful data that models **real-world** or
**conceptual objects** and their **relationships**.

- Objects/Entities like People, Items, Students, etc.
- Relationships like Henry purchased an apple.
- Conceptual like films and songs (*intangible*).

##### Database Management System (DBMS)

A database is managed by a Database Management System - a system that may be
manual or computerised.

To simplify, the DBMS is software designed to store and manage data across one
or more databases.

##### Example

A typical example of a database is a library.

In the case of a library:

- Books = objects containing data
- Catalogue system = DBMS
