A **KEY** in the DBMS is a set of one or more attributes whose values can
*uniquely identify* a given tuple within a relation.

There are generally eight types of keys:

1. Primary Key (PK) is a value that identifies a particular tuple.
1. Unique Key
1. Composite Key
1. Foreign Key
1. Surrogate Key
1. Natural Key

### Super Keys

The **SUPER KEY** is the set of all the keys that, taken collectively, help to
