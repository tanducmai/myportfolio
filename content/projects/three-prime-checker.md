### Introduction

I came up with three different algorithms for determining whether a number is
prime. After running the three, I use a special procedure to time the efficiency
of each algorithm to find out which is better than another. The core of this
project is to adopt different perspectives on a problem, with each way of
handling a problem will have pros or cons over another.

### Algorithms

```text
1. Exclude n if n<2. Now, find its square root, then use a for loop in the range
   between 2 and the square root + 1. If there is no number in the loop that is
   divisible by n, then n is prime.
2. Exclude n if it is less than or equal to 1.
      -   If it is equal to 2, it is prime.
      -   If n is greater than 2, use a for loop in the range between 2 and n,
          if there is not any number in the loop that is divisible by n, then n
          is prime.
3. Firstly, set an initial variable divisible equating to 0. Secondly, use a for
loop in the range between 1 and n+1; if any number in that loop is divisible by
n, add 1 to the variable divisible. When the loop is finished, if the variable
divisible is equal to 2 (means only 1 and n is divisible by n), then n is prime.

A program to check if a number is prime.
Return True if it is, False otherwise.
Also compares which function is the fastest.

Enter a number for evaluation: 9999999
