### Introduction

In a standard game of 2-player Blackjack the player and the dealer are dealt 2
cards. The player shows both cards face-up. The dealer shows one of their cards
face-up and one face-down. The player decides to draw cards by saying, "hit", or
stop drawing cards by saying, "stand". They will draw cards trying to get their
total hand value as close to 21 as possible without going over. If the total
value of cards in their hand exceeds 21, the player "busts", which means they
lose. If the player has not "bust" and they decide to "stand", then it is the
dealer's turn to draw cards. The dealer has a special rule that, as soon as
their hand value is equal to or greater than 17, they must "stand".  If the
dealer exceeds 21, the dealer will "bust", which means the player wins.  It is
possible that both the player and dealer end with the same hand value, in which
case the game is tied and this is called, "push".

In this implementation, if either player gets 21 in their first hand of 2 cards,
they get "blackjack", which means they win immediately. If the dealer has
blackjack, they will reveal their second card, and it will be game over. If both
players have blackjack in their first hand, it will be a "two player blackjack",
which means the game is tied, "push". If neither player has blackjack in their
opening hand, the player will play. If the player busts, the dealer will reveal
their second card and win automatically, otherwise the dealer will play. If the
dealer busts, the player wins, otherwise they decide the winner by comparing
their hand totals; the highest hand total wins.

In this implementation, after the player quits the game, the player's name and
average wins will be added to a text file.  If their win percentage is higher
than all other scores in the file, the game will display, "New High Score!", and
display a table containing all players and their recorded scores.

### Algorithm

My implementation's gameplay is as follows:

```text
1. The player and the dealer are dealt an initial hand of two cards each. The
   player shows both cards. The dealer shows only one card.
2. If the dealer has Blackjack (the first two cards dealt total 21 points) and
   the player does not, the dealer automatically wins.
3. If the player has Blackjack (the first two cards dealt total 21 points) and
   the dealer does not, the player automatically wins.
4. If both the player and the dealer have Blackjack (the first two cards dealt
   total 21 points) then it is a push (draw).
5. If neither have Blackjack, the player then plays out their hand.  Note that
   the term Blackjack can only be achieved as a result of the first two cards
   dealt.
6. When the player has finished playing out their hand, the dealer (in this case
   the computer) plays out the dealer’s hand.
7. During the player’s turn, the player is faced with two options either:
- Hit (take a card): After the initial deal of two cards, a player may choose to
  receive additional cards as many times as they wish, adding the point value of
  each card to their hand total.
- Stand (end their turn): Do not receive any more cards. The player’s turn is
  over.
8. The player repeatedly takes a card until, the player chooses to stand, or the
   player busts i.e., exceeds a total of 21. The player’s turn is over after
   deciding to stand or if they bust.
9. Once the player has finished, if the player has not bust, the dealer reveals
   their hidden second card and plays out their hand. The dealer must hit until
   they have a point value of 17 or greater.
