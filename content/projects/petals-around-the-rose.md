### Aim

Write a Pytram that allows a user to play a game called Petals Around the Rose.
The program allows the user to repeatedly guess the answer to the puzzle until
the user chooses to stop guessing/playing. Once the user chooses to stop
guessing, the program will report the user’s and game play statistics to the
screen.

### Introduction

The name of the game is Petals Around the Rose and the name of the game is
important.  The computer will roll five dice and ask the user to guess the score
for the roll. The score will always be an even number (including zero). The
user’s mission is to work out how the computer calculates the score in order to
become a Potentate of the Rose.

### Further Research

1. To see how this looks in practice, you may like to play a *[web
   version](http://www.borrett.id.au/computing/petals-j.htm)* of the game.
1. You may also like to read the *[online
   article](http://www.borrett.id.au/computing/petals-bg.htm)* about Bill Gates
   and Petals Around the Rose.
1. The *[solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petals_Around_the_Rose)* or
   *[formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petals_Around_the_Rose)* for Petals
   Around the Rose.
