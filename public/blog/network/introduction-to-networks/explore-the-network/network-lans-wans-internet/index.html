<h3 id="network-infrastructure">Network Infrastructure</h3>
<p>Network infrastructures can vary greatly in terms of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Size of the area covered</li>
<li>Number of users connected</li>
<li>Number and types of services available</li>
<li>Area of responsibility</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="common-types">Common Types</h5>
<ol>
<li><strong>Local Area Network (LAN)</strong> - provides access to users and end devices in a
small geographical area, which is typically an enterprise, home, or small
business network owned and managed by an individual or IT department.</li>
<li><strong>Wide Area Network (WAN)</strong> - provides access to other networks over a wide
geographical area, which is typically owned and managed by a
telecommunications service provider.</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="other-types">Other Types</h5>
<ol>
<li><strong>Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)</strong> - spans a physical area larger than a LAN
but smaller than a WAN (e.g., a city).
<ul>
<li>Typically operated by a single entity such as a large organisation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Wireless LAN (WLAN)</strong> - similar to a LAN but wirelessly interconnects users
and end points in a small geographical area.</li>
<li><strong>Storage Area Network (SAN)</strong> - designed to support file servers and provide
data storage, retrieval, and replication.
<ul>
<li>Involves high-end servers, multiple disk arrays (called blocks), and Fibre
Channel interconnection technology.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="local-area-networks">Local Area Networks</h3>
<pre><code>a network infrastructure that spans a small geographical area.
</code></pre>
<p>Specific features of LANs include:</p>
<ol>
<li>LANs interconnect end devices in a limited area such as a home, school,
office building, or campus.</li>
<li>A LAN is usually administered by a single organisation or individual. The
administrative control that governs the security and access control policies
are enforced on the network level.</li>
<li>LANs provide high speed bandwidth to internal end devices and intermediary
devices.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each LAN will have a router as its gateway connecting the LAN to other networks.
Inside the LAN will be one or more hubs or switches to connect the end devices
to the LAN.</p>
<h3 id="wide-area-networks">Wide Area Networks</h3>
<pre><code>a network infrastructure that spans a wide geographical area.
</code></pre>
<p>The sole purpose of WANs is to connect LANs, and there are usually no end users
on WANs.</p>
<p>WANs are typically managed by service providers (SP) or Internet Service
Providers (ISP).</p>
<p>Specific features of WANs include:</p>
<ol>
<li>WANs interconnect LANs over wide geographical areas such as between cities,
states, provinces, countries, or continents.</li>
<li>WANs are usually administered by multiple service providers.</li>
<li>WANs typically provide slower speed links between LANs.</li>
</ol>
<p>If a company has offices in different cities, it will contract with a
telecommunications service provider (TSP) to provide data lines between LANs in
each city. The leased lines will vary in service and bandwidth, depending on the
terms of the contract. The TSP is responsible for the intermediary devices on
the WAN that transports messages, while LANs at both ends are controlled by the
company.</p>
<h3 id="the-internet">The Internet</h3>
<pre><code>a worldwide collection of interconnected networks (internetworks or internet
for short).
</code></pre>
<p>Although there are benefits to using a LAN or a WAN, most individuals need to
communicate with a resource on another network, outside of the local network
within the home, campus, or organisation. This is then done using the Internet.</p>
<p>LANs are connected to each other through a WAN connection. WANs are then
connected to each other through copper wires, fiber optic cables, or wireless
transmissions. The Internet is a collection of interconnected LANs and WANs.</p>
<p>Note: The term internet (with a lower case &ldquo;i&rdquo;) is used to describe multiple
networks interconnected. When referring to the global system of interconnected
computer networks or the World Wide Web, the term Internet (with a capital &ldquo;I&rdquo;)
is used.</p>
<h3 id="intranets-and-extranets">Intranets and Extranets</h3>
<p>There are two other terms which are similar to the term Internet:</p>
<ol>
<li>Intranet</li>
<li>Extranet</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Intranet</strong> is a term that refers to a private connection of LANs and WANs that
belongs to an organisation, and is designed to be accessible only by the
organisation&rsquo;s members, employees, or others with authorisation.</p>
<p>An organisation may use an <strong>extranet</strong> to provide secure and safe access to
individuals who work for a different organisation, but require access to the
organisation&rsquo;s data. Examples of extranets include:</p>
<ol>
<li>A company that is providing access to outside suppliers and contractors.</li>
<li>A hospital that is providing a booking system to doctors so they can make
appointments for their patients.</li>
<li>A local office of education that is providing budget and personnel
information to the schools in its district.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="internet-access-technologies">Internet Access Technologies</h3>
<p>There are many different ways to connect users and organisations to the
Internet.</p>
<p>Home users, teleworkers (remote workers), and small offices typically require a
connection to an Internet Service Provider (ISP) to access the Internet.
Connection options vary greatly between ISP and geographical location. However,
popular choices include broadband cable, broadband digital subscriber line
(DSL), wireless WANs, and mobile services.</p>
<p>Organisations typically require access to other corporate sites and the
Internet. Fast connections are required to support business services including
IP phones, video conferencing, and data centre storage.</p>
<p>Business-class interconnections are usually provided by service providers (SP).
Popular business-class services include business DSL, leased lines, and Metro
Ethernet.</p>
<h3 id="home-and-small-office-internet-connections">Home and Small Office Internet Connections</h3>
<p>Common connection options for small office and home office (SOHO) users include:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Cable</strong> - typically offered by cable television service providers, the
Internet data signal is carried on the same cable that delivers cable
television. It provides a high bandwidth, always on, connection to the
Internet.</li>
<li><strong>Digital Subscriber Lines (DSL)</strong> - provide a high bandwidth, always on,
connection to the Internet. DSL runs over a telephone line. In general, SOHO
users connect using Asymmetrical DSL (ADSL), which means that the download
speed is faster than the upload speed.</li>
<li><strong>Cellular</strong> - uses a cell phone network to connect. Wherever you can get a
cellular signal, you can get cellular Internet access. Performance will be
limited by the capabilities of the phone and the cell tower to which it is
connected.</li>
<li><strong>Satellite</strong> - its availability of is a real benefit in those areas that
would otherwise have no Internet connectivity at all. Satellite dishes
require a clear line of sight to the satellite.</li>
<li><strong>Dial-up Telephone</strong> - An inexpensive option that uses any phone line and a
modem. The low bandwidth provided by a dial-up modem connection is usually
not sufficient for large data transfer, although it is useful for mobile
access while traveling.</li>
</ol>
<p>Many homes and small offices are more commonly being connected directly with
fiber optic cables. This enables an ISP to provide higher bandwidth speeds and
support more services, such as Internet, phone, and TV.</p>
<p>The choice of connection varies depending on geographical location and service
provider availability.</p>
<h3 id="businesses-internet-connections">Businesses Internet Connections</h3>
<p>Corporate connection options differ from home user options. Businesses may
require higher bandwidth, dedicated bandwidth, and managed services. Connection
options available differ depending on the type of service providers located
nearby.</p>
<p>The figure illustrates common connection options for businesses:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Dedicated Leased Line</strong> - Leased lines are actually reserved circuits
within the service provider&rsquo;s network that connect geographically separated
offices for private voice and/or data networking. The circuits are typically
rented at a monthly or yearly rate, which can be expensive.</li>
<li><strong>Ethernet WAN</strong> - extends LAN access technology into the WAN.</li>
<li><strong>DSL</strong> - Business DSL is available in various formats. A popular choice is
Symmetric Digital Subscriber Lines (SDSL) which is similar to the consumer
version of DSL, but provides uploads and downloads at the same speeds.</li>
<li><strong>Satellite</strong> - Similar to SOHO users, satellite service can provide a
connection when a wired solution is not available.</li>
</ol>
<p>The choice of connection varies depending on geographical location and service
provider availability.</p>
