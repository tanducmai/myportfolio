      <description>→ GitHub Introduction Chances are you have a credit card in your wallet or purse. Credit card numbers have a &amp;lsquo;checksum&amp;rsquo; built into them, a mathematical relationship between at least one number and the others. The checksum enables a computer to detect typos, if not fraudulent numbers, without having to query a database (which can be slow). Most cards use an algorithm invented by Hans Peter Luhn, a scientist who worked for IBM.</description>

      <description>→ GitHub Table of Contents  Introduction Algorithm Sample Output  Introduction In a standard game of 2-player Blackjack the player and the dealer are dealt 2 cards. The player shows both cards face-up. The dealer shows one of their cards face-up and one face-down. The player decides to draw cards by saying, &amp;ldquo;hit&amp;rdquo;, or stop drawing cards by saying, &amp;ldquo;stand&amp;rdquo;. They will draw cards trying to get their total hand value as close to 21 as possible without going over.</description>

      <description>→ GitHub Table of Contents  Introduction Aim Implementation Usage Restrictions Sample Output  Introduction to Python Lists A list is an object that contains multiple data items. Lists are mutable, which means that their contents can be changed during a program’s execution. Lists are dynamic data structures, meaning that items may be added to them or removed from them. Indexing, slicing, and various methods can be used to work with lists in a program.</description>

The program allows the user to repeatedly guess the answer to the puzzle until the user chooses to stop guessing/playing. Once the user chooses to stop guessing, the program will report the user’s and game play statistics to the screen.</description>

      <description>→ GitHub Table of Contents  Aim Implementation Output Video Production  Aim Use Turtle graphics to draw an illustration of the Solar System, with appropriate scaling.
Implementation There are two algorithms that I constantly use when working with a Python Turtle project, which is making a turtle and moving it. Accordingly, I define the two functions to eliminate repetitive code and put them into a new Python file. This is to make it possible to break up such a large program into manageable sized parts, and to keep related parts together.</description>

      <description>→ GitHub Table of Contents  Introduction Algorithms Sample Output  Introduction I came up with three different algorithms for determining whether a number is prime. After running the three, I use a special procedure to time the efficiency of each algorithm to find out which is better than another. The core of this project is to adopt different perspectives on a problem, with each way of handling a problem will have pros or cons over another.</description>

Leaderboard Source: Adelaide Advertiser 3 August 2021
Implementation To begin, I convert the numbers of gold medals into percentages in order to draw the pie chart’s segments. The corresponding percentage is converted by dividing the number of gold medals by 360%.</description>

      <description>→ GitHub Table of Contents  Aim Implementation For Loop - While Loop Sample Output  Aim Create a number guessing game divided into three levels of difficulty. I divide this project into small functions and place them in separate files to be used as modules.
Implementation I begin by greeting the user and prompt them to choose which level (easy, medium, or hard) they want to play | welcome.py. With that option, I then start the corresponding function which is stored in options.</description>
