      <description>→ Go to GitHub Introduction Chances are you have a credit card in your wallet or purse. Credit card numbers have a &amp;lsquo;checksum&amp;rsquo; built into them, a mathematical relationship between at least one number and the others. The checksum enables a computer to detect typos, if not fraudulent numbers, without having to query a database (which can be slow).

The dealer shows one of their cards face-up and one face-down. The player decides to draw cards by saying, &amp;ldquo;hit&amp;rdquo;, or stop drawing cards by saying, &amp;ldquo;stand&amp;rdquo;. They will draw cards trying to get their total hand value as close to 21 as possible without going over. If the total value of cards in their hand exceeds 21, the player &amp;ldquo;busts&amp;rdquo;, which means they lose.</description>
