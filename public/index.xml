      <description>Table Of Contents  Definition Hypotheses Syntax Categorisation Intra-relational Constraints Inter-relational Constraints  Definition Constraints are clauses that need to be satisfied by data in the database.
Constraints are like contracts to guard against bad data.
Data that does not meet the rules of a given constraint will not be saved to the database.
 The whole tuple (new record) gets rejected and the DBMS throws an SQL Error. For example:  PRIMARY KEY Violation FOREIGN KEY Violation CHECK CONSTRAINT Violation    Hypotheses Consider this example:</description>

 Structured Query Language (SQL) is a higher-level language (4GL) used to create the relational database and manage data within the database.  For example:
CREATE TABLE Project ( projectName varchar(200), budget decimal(6,2), manager varchar(200), CONSTRAINT PK_Project PRIMARY KEY (projectName), CONSTRAINT FK_Project_Manager FOREIGN KEY (manager) REFERENCES Manager (name) ); SQL Overview Categorisation SQL commands can be categorised into:</description>

Good and Bad Database Designs When designing a database, people tend to do one that captures all or too much of the required information.
It should be noted that more than one design are plausible.
 One design may be better than another.</description>

Picking a good Primary Key from a list of available Candidate Keys might be an unappealing process, but try to stick to these rules to make your life easier.
Keep The Primary Key As Small As Possible Imagine that the PK will be distributed among other relations.
 1000s of copies of that PK value will appear in the database, which will overload the system.  That is, the smaller they are, the fewer bytes the DBMS has to load into RAM to find related records.</description>

What Is A Key A KEY in the DBMS is a set of one or more attributes whose values can uniquely identify a given tuple within a relation.
There are generally eight types of keys:
 Super Key Candidate Key (CK) (name given to all keys) Primary Key (PK) is a value that identifies a particular tuple.</description>

      <description>→ GitHub Introduction Chances are you have a credit card in your wallet or purse. Credit card numbers have a &amp;lsquo;checksum&amp;rsquo; built into them, a mathematical relationship between at least one number and the others. The checksum enables a computer to detect typos, if not fraudulent numbers, without having to query a database (which can be slow). Most cards use an algorithm invented by Hans Peter Luhn, a scientist who worked for IBM.</description>

The player decides to draw cards by saying, &amp;ldquo;hit&amp;rdquo;, or stop drawing cards by saying, &amp;ldquo;stand&amp;rdquo;. They will draw cards trying to get their total hand value as close to 21 as possible without going over.</description>

Lists are mutable, which means that their contents can be changed during a program’s execution. Lists are dynamic data structures, meaning that items may be added to them or removed from them. Indexing, slicing, and various methods can be used to work with lists in a program.</description>

Implementation There are two algorithms that I constantly use when working with a Python Turtle project, which is making a turtle and moving it. Accordingly, I define the two functions to eliminate repetitive code and put them into a new Python file. This is to make it possible to break up such a large program into manageable sized parts, and to keep related parts together.</description>

      <description>→ GitHub Table of Contents  Introduction Algorithms Sample Output  Introduction I came up with three different algorithms for determining whether a number is prime. After running the three, I use a special procedure to time the efficiency of each algorithm to find out which is better than another. The core of this project is to adopt different perspectives on a problem, with each way of handling a problem will have pros or cons over another.</description>
