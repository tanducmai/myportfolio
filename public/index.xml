  Common Functions
  Date-related Functions
  What is a Function Functions are calculations performed by the Database Management System (DBMS).
Common functions Common functions include:
   Function Example Output     LEFT(string, length) LEFT(&amp;lsquo;Sam&amp;rsquo;, 2) Sam -&amp;gt; Sa   RIGHT(string, length) RIGHT(&amp;lsquo;Sam&amp;rsquo;, 2) Sam -&amp;gt; am   CHARINDEX(str1, str2) CHARINDEX(&amp;lsquo;Fun&amp;rsquo;, DBFundamentals&amp;rsquo;) 3   SUBSTRING(col, start, len) SUBSTRING(Name, 1, 1) Returns char(s) at start position    CHARINDEX starts from 0 and counts to the length.</description>

SQL provides users with many aggregate functions for aggregate queries, including AVG, COUNT, SUM, MIN, MAX, etc.
Aggregate functions can be used within three clauses, namely SELECT, HAVING, and ORDER BY.</description>

Constraints are like contracts to guard against bad data.
Data that does not meet the rules of a given constraint will not be saved to the database.
 The whole tuple (new record) gets rejected and the DBMS throws an SQL Error. For example:  PRIMARY KEY Violation FOREIGN KEY Violation CHECK CONSTRAINT Violation    Hypotheses Consider this example:</description>

Picking a good Primary Key from a list of available Candidate Keys might be an unappealing process, but try to stick to these rules to make your life easier.
Keep The Primary Key As Small As Possible Imagine that the PK will be distributed among other relations.
 1000s of copies of that PK value will appear in the database, which will overload the system.  That is, the smaller they are, the fewer bytes the DBMS has to load into RAM to find related records.</description>

What Is A Key A KEY in the DBMS is a set of one or more attributes whose values can uniquely identify a given tuple within a relation.
There are generally eight types of keys:
 Super Key Candidate Key (CK) (name given to all keys) Primary Key (PK) is a value that identifies a particular tuple.</description>

Credit card numbers have a &amp;lsquo;checksum&amp;rsquo; built into them, a mathematical relationship between at least one number and the others. The checksum enables a computer to detect typos, if not fraudulent numbers, without having to query a database (which can be slow). Most cards use an algorithm invented by Hans Peter Luhn, a scientist who worked for IBM.</description>
