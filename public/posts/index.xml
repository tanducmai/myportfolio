      <description>Table of Contents  Stored procedures Syntax VIEWS @varName  Stored procedures Stored Procedures (SPs) are pre-written SQL queries stored by the DBMS They are similar to Views in that they are called when required
Unlike views they may contain INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT queries or any combination of these! Often SPs are used to perform basic CRUD tasks (create, read, update, delete) Other SPs are used to perform complex calculations needed for generating reports or transforming data</description>

Database views Views are very useful for complex queries Queries with lots of joins Queries with complex conditions (e.g. aggregates) Especially if the queries are used frequently
Views are necessary to express certain queries queries that combine and nest aggregate operators queries that make sophisticated use on the UNION operator</description>

Constraints are like contracts to guard against bad data.
Data that does not meet the rules of a given constraint will not be saved to the database.
 The whole tuple (new record) gets rejected and the DBMS throws an SQL Error. For example:  PRIMARY KEY Violation FOREIGN KEY Violation CHECK CONSTRAINT Violation    Hypotheses Consider this example:</description>

Picking a good Primary Key from a list of available Candidate Keys might be an unappealing process, but try to stick to these rules to make your life easier.
Keep The Primary Key As Small As Possible Imagine that the PK will be distributed among other relations.
 1000s of copies of that PK value will appear in the database, which will overload the system.  That is, the smaller they are, the fewer bytes the DBMS has to load into RAM to find related records.</description>

What Is A Key A KEY in the DBMS is a set of one or more attributes whose values can uniquely identify a given tuple within a relation.
There are generally eight types of keys:
 Super Key Candidate Key (CK) (name given to all keys) Primary Key (PK) is a value that identifies a particular tuple.</description>
